/**
 * A parse failure must not reproduce the document it failed on, and here the
 * document is a captured webhook payload -- the kind of file that carries a
 * signing secret, a card number or a customer's name.
 *
 * V8 reports a `JSON.parse` failure two ways. One names an offset and says
 * nothing about the content. The other quotes the input back:
 * `Unexpected token 'A', "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE" is not valid JSON` -- the whole
 * document when it is short, a ten-character window when it is not.
 *
 * The ORDER inside `parseFailureDetail` is the defence, and it is pinned here
 * rather than only through a fixture run. Searching for the offset BEFORE
 * recognising the quoting shape looks safe and is not: a payload whose own text
 * reads `at position 1` supplies that phrase from inside the quoted span, and
 * the slice hands the payload straight back. Every case below fails if that
 * order is reverted.
 *
 * The canary is AWS's published documentation placeholder, not a credential.
